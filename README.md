Yeow, yeow
Yeow
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah
I watched with glee (whoo-hoo)
While your kings and queens (whoo-hoo)
Fought for ten decades (whoo-hoo)
For the gods they made (whoo-hoo)
I shouted out (whoo-hoo)
"Who killed the Kennedy's?" (whoo-hoo)
When after all (whoo-hoo)
It was you and me (whoo-hoo)
Let me please introduce myself (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
I'm a man of wealth and taste (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
And I laid traps for troubadours (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Who get killed before they reach Bombay (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Pleased to meet you (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
But what's puzzlin' you (whoo-hoo)
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Get down, damn it
Pleased to meet you (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
But what's confusing you (whoo-hoo)
Is just the nature of my game, mm yeah (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Just as every cop is a criminal (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
And all the sinners saints (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
So if you meet me, have some courtesy (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Have some sympathy, and some taste (whoo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Use all your well-learned politeness (whoo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah (whoo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Pleased to meet you (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
But what's puzzlin' you (whoo-hoo)
Is the nature of my game, mean it (whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo)
Get down
whoo-hoo
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) oh yeah, get on down
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) oh, yeah
yeah
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) aw, yeah! A-tell me, baby
what's my name, tell me, honey
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo) can ya guess my name, a-tell me, baby
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo) what's my name, I tell you one time
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo) you're to blame, ooh
ooh-hoo
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) alright
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) whoo-hoo-hoo, oh yeah, whoo-hoo-hoo
whoo-hoo-hoo, oh yeah
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo) oh, what's my name, a-tell me baby
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo) what's my name, tell me, sweetie
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo) a-what's my name, whoo-hoo-hoo
whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) whoo-hoo-hoo
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo-hoo
(Whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo) whoo-hoo-hoo, oh yeah
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo)
(Whoo-woo, whoo-woo)
